# 🚚 Supply Chain Disruption Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Supply chain disruptions such as shipment delays can cause major losses for companies.
This project predicts whether a disruption (delay) will occur based on key supply chain factors.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts supply chain disruption using:

- Supplier Delay Days  
- Transport Issues  
- Inventory Level  
- Demand Surge  
- Weather Risk  

Target Variable:

- **Disruption = 1** → Delay Expected  
- **Disruption = 0** → No Delay

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📊 Workflow

1. Dataset Creation (Synthetic Supply Chain Data)
2. Data Exploration and Visualization (EDA)
3. Feature Selection (X and y)
4. Train-Test Split
5. Model Training using Random Forest Classifier
6. Model Evaluation:
   - Accuracy Score  
   - Classification Report  
   - Confusion Matrix  
7. Feature Importance Analysis
8. Real-Time Disruption Prediction System

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Use real-world logistics datasets  
- Add features like supplier location, shipping distance, fuel cost  
- Deploy as a Streamlit web application
